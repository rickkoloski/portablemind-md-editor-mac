# Chronicle by step — md-editor timeline

**Type:** Reference — chronological index of completed deliverables. Concept chronicles are the primary navigation surface (`chronicle_by_concept/`); this file is the by-when backup.

Each row links to the deliverable's COMPLETE doc inside its concept folder. Active deliverables in flight (none currently) and pending deliverables (D20, D23+) live in `docs/roadmap_ref.md`, not here.

- ⚠️ = retired/historical concept. The deliverables are real; the code is gone (replaced or deleted by a later deliverable).
- Branches were deleted after merge; names preserved here for git-history archaeology.
